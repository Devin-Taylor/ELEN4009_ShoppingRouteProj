		\subsection{Product Perspective}
		
			The Shopping Route Recommender is an application used by consumers to maximise their shopping experience in terms of three preferred optimisations: minimum cost, travel distance and travel time. The consumer is able to log onto a Website or Smartphone application and create a shopping list with a desired route being generated.  Enabling a user to optimise their shopping experience is a potential success from the start, as their daily routines can become more efficiently and effectively undertaken. The application's use is not only restricted to the general public, but can also be used by businesses and companies involved in the stock collection courier service industries. The application is aimed at being user friendly, simple, and interactive with maximum customisation being a priority aspect in order to maximise an individuals needs.

				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		
		\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
		
			Shopping Route Recommender is platform independent and is written in \textcolor{red}{language}. In addition, Google Maps API is implemented for generating the desired optimised shopping route. The accuracy of the generated route and optimisation algorithms is therefore dependent on the accuracy of the Google Maps detailing. 
		
		\subsection{User Documentation}
		
		   	A general help and FAQ menu will be provided within the application. This will function as the "user manual" of the application. 
		
		\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
	
	\section{System Features}
	
		Shopping Route Recommender was designed with user experience as its primary concern. As a result of this the product features are simplistic in nature in order to provide the customer with only the essentials.	This section provides a detailed description of each system features in order to make future system extensions as easy as possible. 
	
		\subsection{System Feature 1 - Adding items to shopping cart}
		
			\subsubsection{Description}
			
				The Shopping Route Recommender's primary feature is for the user to be able to continuously add shopping items to their cart. The user will be able to continuously log into the application and add items to the shopping cart on an add-hock basis. These items will remain in the basket until such time that the user wants to go shopping. 
			
			\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
			
				The user will click in the "Add Items" field at which point a list will be displayed that will contain all previously added items listed one after the other (in the order in which they were added). Within this list the user will be able to complete one of the following actions:

					\item The user can only remove a single item at a time.
					\item The user can only edit a single item at a time.
				\end{itemize}
